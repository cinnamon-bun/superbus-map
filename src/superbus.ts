Superbus

A message bus with a few tricks up its sleeve.

Listeners can subscribe by adding a callback like

    let myBus = new Superbus();
    myBus.on('something', (channel, data) => {
        // channel is the name of the channel again, 'something'
        // data is any payload that came with the message.
    });

When you subscribe you get an unsubscribe function back:

    let unsub = myBus.on('something', () => {});
    unsub();

--------------
Message specificity, '*', and special handling of messages with ids

Subscribers can listen to the '*' channel to get all events:

    myBus.on('*', () => {});

A message can have an ID attached to it by combining it into the channel name
separated by a ':':

    myBus.sendLater('changed:abc', myData);

This represents a change event for the "abc" object, whatever that means to you.

Messages with IDs are considered to be "more specific' than other messages.
Sending the message above will trigger all 3 of these listeners, in order from
most to least specific:

    myBus.on('changed:abc', () => {});  // only when item "abc' has changed
    myBus.on('changed', () => {});      // when anything is changed
    myBus.on('*', () => {});            // any message at all

Similarly, sending a regular "changed" message with no ID will trigger these listeners:

    myBus.on('changed', () => {});      // when anything is changed
    myBus.on('*', () => {});            // any message at all

In other words, listeners will hear the channel they signed up for and any
channels that are more specific.

Only the first colon is detected:
    sending "changed:a:b:c"
    will trigger listeners for "changed:a:b:c", "changed", and "*"

':' is the default is separator character, but you can change it in the constructor.

--------------
Backpressure and special async behavior

There are two ways to send a message:

    myBus.sendLater('hello', data);
    await myBus.sendAndWait('hello', data);

(The data argument is optional.  It defaults to undefined.)

sendLater sends your message on process.nextTick:

    myBus.sendLater('hello');
    // at this point, listeners have not run yet.
    // they will not start running until nextTick.

sendAndWait runs the listener callbacks right away and waits for them all to finish,
even the async ones.  Make sure to "await" it.

    await myBus.sendAndWait('hello');
    // at this point, all listener callbacks are done running.

The async callbacks are run in parallel and we wait for them to all
to finish using Promise.allSettled().

If you forget the "await" on sendAndWait, only the synchronous callbacks will finish
running before your code continues.  The async callbacks will be started but won't
finish until later.

--------------
Generic types

The allowed channel strings can be specified in the generic type:

    new Superbus<string>();

    type MyChannels = 'open' | 'close';
    new Superbus<MyChannels>();

If you specify specific channel names this way, you won't be able to use
dynamic channel names that include ids, or you'll have to give Typescript
some extra help:

    myBus.sendLater('open:123' as 'open'); 
    myBus.on('open:123' as 'open', () => {});
